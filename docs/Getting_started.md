## Files

The File menu lets you view and use files in different file spaces: your home directory and the projects directory (/shared/projects).
Selecting one of the file spaces takes you to a page that lets you navigate through the space in a graphical frame similar to a file browser on a personal computer. From here you can download, upload, create, delete and open files.

!!! Warning "Attention"

    The projects space contains all the "projects" directories hosted on the infrastructure. When you do not have access to a project, you will see an Error message like the one in the image below.
